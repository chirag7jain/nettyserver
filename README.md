# Sample Netty Server

Non blocking server implemented in Java using Netty Package

Similar to Scalable-NIO [https://github.com/USF-DATALab/scalable-nio]

Built to do comparative performance analysis with similar core NIO implementation [the above one]

There are a lot of difference in both the implementations, tried to reduce them as much as I can understand to get a decent comparision

I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN NIO OR NETTY
